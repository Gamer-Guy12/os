kio_printf and kio_puts will print to screen unless the kernel sets a flag at runtime to start printing to a log file (requires fs)
kgfx_putchar will print to screen until it is told to go into graphics mode at which it will panic

gfx drivers:
each one exposes some thingies in a struct
how to figure out which driver to use
  - There could be multiple monitors
  - Kernel exposes monitor count and you can request which monitor to get the graphics info for
  - kgfx will always use monitor 0 (cuz its for kernel stuff and should be not used or smthing for others)

This is too complex for now kgfx justs assumes vga shit and works from there
this stuff can be done later
